        <b>7. Our right to vary these terms</b>
        <ol>
          <li>
            7.1 We have the right to revise and amend these Terms from time to time to reflect changes in market conditions affecting our business, changes in technology, changes in payment methods, changes in relevant laws and regulatory requirements and changes in our system's capabilities.
          </li>
          <li>
            7.2 Every time you order Products from us, and confirm your acceptance to the Terms by entering your Password, the Terms in force at the time you submit your order will apply to the Contract between you and us, unless any change to those policies or the Terms is required to be made by law or governmental authority (in which case it will apply to orders previously placed by you), or if we notify you of the change to those policies or these Terms before we send you the Confirmation Email (in which case we have the right to assume that you have accepted the change to the Terms, unless you notify us to the contrary within seven (7) working days of receipt by you of the Product).
          </li>
          <li>
            7.3 Whenever we revise these Terms in accordance with this clause 7, we will keep you informed and give you notice of this by stating that these Terms have been amended and the relevant date at the top of this page.

        <b>8. Your right of return and refund</b>
        <ol>
          <li>
            8.1 You have a legal right to cancel a Contract under the Consumer Protection (Distance Selling) Regulations 2000 during the period set out below in clause 8.3. This means that during the relevant period if you change your mind or for any other reason you decide you do not want to keep a Product, you can notify us of your decision to cancel the Contract and receive a refund. Advice about your legal right to cancel the Contract under these regulations is available from your local Citizens' Advice Bureau or Trading Standards office.
          </li>
          <li>
            8.2 However, this cancellation right does not apply in the case of any made-to-measure or custom-made products. For the avoidance of doubt, Products containing personalised designs (for example text or images) will be considered custom-made products for the purposes of this clause 8.
          </li>
          <li>
            8.3 Subject to clause 8.2, in relation to non-custom-made products, your legal right to cancel a Contract starts from the date of the Confirmation Email, which is when the Contract between us is formed. If the Products have already been delivered to you, you have a period of seven (7) working days in which you may cancel, starting from the day after the day you receive the Products. Working days means that Saturdays, Sundays or public holidays are not included in this period.
          </li>
          <li>
            8.4 For clarification, you have a right to cancel your order (regardless of customisation) at any time before the date of the Confirmation Email.
          </li>
          <li>
            8.5 To cancel a Contract, you must contact us in writing by sending an email to theoons@miioon.com . You may wish to keep a copy of your cancellation notification for your own records. Your cancellation is effective from the date you sent the cancellation notice to us by email.
          </li>
          <li>
            8.6 If your cancellation is successful, you will receive a full refund of the price you paid for the Products and any applicable delivery charges you have already paid for. We will process the refund due to you as soon as possible and, in any case, within thirty (30) calendar days of the day on which you gave us notice of cancellation as described in clause 8.5. If you returned the Products to us because they were faulty, please see clause 8.7.
          </li>
          <li>
            8.7 If you have returned the Products to us under this clause 8 because they are faulty, we will refund the price of a defective Product in full, any applicable delivery charges, and any reasonable costs you incur in returning the item to us.
          </li>
          <li>
            8.8 In the event of a successful cancellation, we will refund you on the credit card or debit card, used by you to pay.

          <li>
            8.9 If the Products were delivered to you:
            <ol>
              <li>
                (a) you must return the Products to us as soon as reasonably practicable; and
              </li>
              <li>
                (b) unless the Products are faulty or not as described (in this case, see clause 8.7), you will be responsible for the cost of returning the Products to us; and
              </li>
              <li>
                (c) you have a legal obligation to keep the Products in your possession and to take reasonable care of the Products while they are in your possession.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            8.10 Details of your legal right to cancel and an explanation of how to exercise it are provided in the Confirmation Email, your Confirmation Email shall also confirm which goods are considered custom-made.
          </li>
          <li>
            8.11 As a consumer, you will always have legal rights in relation to Products that are faulty or not as described. These legal rights are not affected by the returns policy in this clause 8 or these Terms.

        <ol>
          <li>
            10.1 The prices of the Products will be as quoted on our site from time to time. We take all reasonable care to ensure that the prices of Products are correct at the time when the relevant information was entered onto the system.

          </li>
          <li>
            10.2 Prices for our Products may change from time to time, but changes will not affect the price of any order which we have confirmed with a Confirmation Email.
          </li>
          <li>
            10.3 The price of a Product includes VAT (where applicable) at the applicable current rate and shall be set out in the Confirmation Email. However, if the rate of VAT changes between the date of your order and the date of payment, we will adjust the VAT you pay, unless you have already paid for the Products in full before the change in VAT takes effect.
          </li>
          <li>
            10.4 The price of a Product does not include delivery charges. Our delivery charges are as quoted on our site from time to time.
          </li>
          <li>
            10.5 Our site contains a number of Products. It is always possible that, despite our reasonable efforts, some of the Products on our site may be incorrectly priced. If we discover an error in the price of the Products you have ordered we will inform you of this error and we will give you the option of continuing to purchase the Product at the correct price or cancelling your order. We will not process your order until we have your instructions. If we are unable to contact you using the contact details you provided during the order process, we will treat the order as cancelled and notify you in writing. Please note that if the pricing error is obvious and unmistakeable and could have reasonably been recognised by you as a mispricing, we do not have to provide the Products to you at the incorrect (lower) price.

          <li>
            15.1 We may transfer our rights and obligations under a Contract to another organisation, but this will not affect your rights or our obligations under these Terms.

            15.5 If we fail to insist that you perform any of your obligations under these Terms, or if we do not enforce our rights against you, or if we delay in doing so, that will not mean that we have waived our rights against you and will not mean that you do not have to comply with those obligations. If we do waive a default by you, we will only do so in writing, and that will not mean that we will automatically waive any later default by you.
          </li>
          <li>
            15.6 Please note that these Terms are governed by English law.
